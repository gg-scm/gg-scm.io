<h1 class="pagetitle">Working Locally</h1>
<p>Whether you are working by yourself or with others, the workflow for making
changes on your local machine stays the same. This guide is primarily aimed at
those who are new to version control, but is also useful for seasoned version
control users trying to see how gg stacks up to their current tool.</p>

<h2 id="creating-a-repository">Creating a Repository</h2>

<p>To create an empty repository, you use <a href="/cmd/init/"><code>gg init</code></a>.</p>

<pre><code class="language-shell">gg init foo
cd foo
</code></pre>

<p>This will create a new folder <code>foo</code> with a <code>.git</code> directory inside it.</p>

<h2 id="adding-files">Adding Files</h2>

<p>Let&rsquo;s say you create a file inside your new repository:</p>

<pre><code class="language-shell">nano my-thoughts.txt
</code></pre>

<p>gg will not track <code>my-thoughts.txt</code> until you explicitly tell it to, using <a href="/cmd/add/"><code>gg
add</code></a>:</p>

<pre><code class="language-shell">gg add my-thoughts.txt
</code></pre>

<p>You can then save your work to the repository using <a href="/cmd/commit/"><code>gg commit</code></a>. This will
create a new <a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/gitglossary#def_commit">Git commit</a>.</p>

<pre><code class="language-shell">gg commit -m &quot;Started thinking&quot;
</code></pre>

<p>Every commit has a message. A commit message should be a short, human-readable
summary of what you did in that commit. A quick internet search for &ldquo;good commit
messages&rdquo; includes advice on how to write a good commit message and why this is
important, especially when collaborating with others.</p>

<h2 id="modifying-files">Modifying Files</h2>

<p>Let&rsquo;s say you add more to <code>my-thoughts.txt</code>. You can get a short summary of the
files that have changed by using <a href="/cmd/status/"><code>gg status</code></a>:</p>

<pre><code class="language-shell">gg status
</code></pre>

<p>This would show something like:</p>

<pre><code>M my-thoughts.txt
</code></pre>

<p>If you want a more detailed view of your changes, you can use <a href="/cmd/diff/"><code>gg diff</code></a> (short for differences).</p>

<pre><code class="language-shell">gg diff
</code></pre>

<p>This would show something like:</p>

<pre><code>diff --git a/my-thoughts.txt b/my-thoughts.txt
--- a/my-thoughts.txt
+++ b/my-thoughts.txt
@@ -1,1 +1,2 @@
 Hello, World!
+I'm learning gg!
</code></pre>

<p>When you&rsquo;re ready to make a new commit, you run <code>gg commit</code> like before.</p>

<pre><code class="language-shell">gg commit -m &quot;Documented my experience in following a gg tutorial&quot;
</code></pre>

<p>Long-time Git users will notice that we did not have to &ldquo;add&rdquo; the files before
committing. This is intentional: gg makes every effort to emulate Mercurial&rsquo;s
index-less model to reduce the number of steps in common workflows. To commit
only certain files, just pass them as arguments to <code>gg commit</code>. For more
advanced partial commits, use <code>git add</code> and <code>git commit</code> directly.</p>

<h2 id="removing-files">Removing Files</h2>

<p>Sometimes, you will want to remove a file that has been tracked by version
control. To do this, you run <a href="/cmd/remove/"><code>gg rm</code></a> followed by <code>gg commit</code>.</p>

<pre><code class="language-shell">gg rm my-thoughts.txt
gg commit -m &quot;Kept my thoughts to myself&quot;
</code></pre>

<p>Don&rsquo;t worry, the file is still in your repository history. Let&rsquo;s see how to use
gg to go back in time.</p>

<h2 id="examining-history">Examining History</h2>

<p>The primary motivation for version control is to be able to inspect previous
revisions of files. gg includes several commands to access the repository&rsquo;s
data.</p>

<p>The first command is <a href="/cmd/log/"><code>gg log</code></a>.</p>

<pre><code class="language-shell">gg log
</code></pre>

<p><code>gg log</code> will show you a list of all the commits you have made up to this point.
Each commit is identified by a long hexadecimal string called the <a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/gitglossary#def_hash">hash</a>. You
can use the hash to reference the commit in other commands or when talking with
other people.</p>

<p>If you want to see the changes made in a single commit, you can pass the <code>-c</code>
flag to <code>gg diff</code> with a hash you found from the log.</p>

<pre><code class="language-shell">gg diff -c a199be2
</code></pre>

<p>You can also see all the changes made since a particular commit using <code>-r</code>:</p>

<pre><code class="language-shell">gg diff -r a199be2
</code></pre>

<p>If you want to check out what the repository looked like at a particular commit,
you can use the <a href="/cmd/update/"><code>gg update</code></a>, also known as <code>checkout</code>.</p>

<pre><code class="language-shell">gg checkout -r a199be2
</code></pre>

<p>When you&rsquo;re done looking, you can go back to your latest work using <code>checkout</code>.</p>

<pre><code class="language-shell">gg checkout -r main
</code></pre>

<p><code>main</code> is the name of the default <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/about-branches/">branch</a> that was created when you ran <code>gg
init</code>. You can use the name of a branch instead of a commit hash in any gg
command that takes in a commit to indicate the latest commit on that branch.</p>

<p>Finally, if you realize you made a mistake (perhaps you want <code>my-thoughts.txt</code>
back), you can use <code>gg revert</code> to bring files back to their state at a given
commit, then use <code>gg commit</code> to save your work as normal.</p>

<pre><code class="language-shell">gg revert -r a199be2 my-thoughts.txt
gg commit -m &quot;Brought back my thoughts&quot;
</code></pre>

<h2 id="next-steps">Next Steps</h2>

<p>If you are using gg just by yourself, this may be all you need to know. Version
control lets you keep track of how your files have changed over time, and lets
you bring back files you may have accidentally deleted. However, version control
is an important tool for being able to share these changes with others. Once
you&rsquo;ve gotten used to the commands in this guide, take a look at the other
<a href="/workflow/">workflows</a> to see how to share your work with others. You may also want to
look at the <a href="/cmd/">command reference</a>.</p>
